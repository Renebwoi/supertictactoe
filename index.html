    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Super Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as ultimate tic-tac-toe) is a better variant of the basic tic-tac-toe game</p>
    <p>a huge 3 by 3 grid is created which consists of smaller games of tic-tac-toe</p>
    <p>if a player plays at a certain position in any of the smaller tic-tac-toe boxes, 
        the opponent has to play in the corresponding tic-tac-toe game. 
        for example, playing in the second box of any of the smaller boxes will
         force the opponent to play anywhere in the second game</p>
    <p>If any of the smaller game is won, that game is given to the player that won it</p>
    <p> If the corresponding row to be played in is already won or drawn. The opponent is free to play anywhere else</p>
    <p>The game is won if any player wins 3 games in a row, column or diagonally. It can also be drawn</p>
