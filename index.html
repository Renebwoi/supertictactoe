    <p class="Desc">Super Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as ultimate tic-tac-toe) is a better variant of the basic tic-tac-toe game</p>
    <!-- <img src="#" title="super tic-tac-toe image" id="superImage" alt="The super tic-tac description" /> -->
    <p>A huge 3 by 3 grid is created which consists of smaller games of tic-tac-toe</p>
    <ul>
        <li>if a player plays at a certain position in any of the smaller tic-tac-toe boxes, 
            the opponent has to play in the corresponding tic-tac-toe game. 
            for example, playing in the second box of any of the smaller boxes will
            force the opponent to play anywhere in the second game</li>
        <li>If any of the smaller game is won, that game is given to the player that won it</>
        <li> If the corresponding row to be played in is already won or drawn. The opponent is free to play anywhere else</li>
        <li>The game is won if any player wins 3 games in a row, column or diagonally. It can also be drawn</li>
