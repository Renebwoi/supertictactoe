# to program for the final game

# make a general array with empty elements
# finalGamearray= [,,,,,,,,,]

# for each of the results, replace the index with the correct value
# 0 O is for o winning example finalGamearray[0] = "O" for O winning the first Tac
# 1 X is for X winning
# 2 D is for draw

# write the if chain for checking the result
# research javascript DOM loader later

Tac-blocker

first I'll add the Tac blocker when a tac is won
the tac blocker will be white and displays boldly who won, lost or draw

create an absolute element that z-indexes blocks the tac when won
set its z-index to lower default
and displays anytime the result is triggered

put it in a general function and just call it for all results

To check for final game draw
if the finalGamearray doesn't have any empty element or is all filled up, we conclude it as a draw

this check should happen on every click
